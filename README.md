Development environment
=======================

## Overview

As it's always cumbersome to manually setup development environment I've created this repository. It contains a number of configuration files to easily initialize and provision Ubuntu based development environment. Thanks to Vagrant and Ansible projects for great tools that made it possible.

## How to use

Assuming Vagrant and Ansible are already installed it is as easy as executing the following command:

```bash
vagrant up
```

Please review the contents of tasks directory to find out what's going under the hood.
